--The code starts by checking to see if the player has any scripts attached to them.
--If they do, it then checks which script is attached to the player's chat and bubblechat.
--It then waits for a second before destroying both of those scripts.
--After that, it warns the user that anti-cheat was successfully bypassed ez
--The code will call the task.wait() function and then destroy the AntiCheatScript_1 and AntiCheatScript_2 variables, which are both PlayerScripts.
--The warning message "anti cheat successfully bypassed ez" is then displayed on-screen in a text box.
